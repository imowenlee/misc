/*
Given a string "Hello, World" and an array of commands [[1, 3, 'b'], [5, 9, 'i'], [7, 11, 'u']], each command consists of start position, end position and style, which style 'b' means bold, 'i' to italic, and 'u' to underline. Please write a function to output a corresponding HTML string.

According to the above example, write down how the output (HTML string) will look like?

		"H<b>el</b>lo<i>, </i><u><i>Wo</i></u><u>rl</u>d"

Handling nested tags is complicated, can you write a function to transform the commands to like:

		"start b at 1 position",
"end b at 3",
"start i at 5",
"end i at 7",
"start u at 7",
"start i at 7",
...

How do you design the format of transformed input?
Finish whole algorithm.
